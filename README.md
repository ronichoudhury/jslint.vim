# jslint.vim: A Vim quickfix plugin for Node jslint

## About

jslint.vim runs [Node JSLint](http://www.jslint.com) on your JavaScript code,
and lets you use the quickfix panel to bring it up to snuff.

It only requires `jslint` to be in your path.  The easiest way is via [Node
Packaged Modules](https://npmjs.org/).  Install that, and then

    npm install -g jslint

## Installation

Use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) or
[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/).  Easy!

## Usage

Open a file you want to de-lint, then simply do

    :JSLint

The quickfix window will open, and you can use `j` and `k` to navigate through
the error list, `<CR>` to select an error to jump to and fix, and `q` to close
the quickfix window.
